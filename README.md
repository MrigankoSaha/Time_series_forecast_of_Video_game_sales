# Time_series_forecast_of_Video_game_sales

## Description

This project explores sales trends in the video game industry using time series forecasting techniques to provide us valuable 
insights for industry stakeholders. The video game market constantly changes and encompasses a wide range of platforms and 
genres, understanding sales dynamics is important for developers, publishers, and marketers to refine pricing strategies, optimize 
release schedules, and plan production effectively. The study uses a dataset of video game sales spanning from 1980 to 2020. 
Preprocessing steps such as stationarity checks were used like Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, followed by 
Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and then Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) analyses to identify patterns within the data. 
Challenges arose when analyzing data post-2011 due to a significant reduction in entries, leading to unreliable forecasts. To fix 
this, the analysis focused on predictions from 2006 to 2019. Using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) 
model, the project revealed key patterns in sales trends. The findings showed the consistent popularity of genres like action and 
sports games, alongside the influence of platforms such as PlayStation and Nintendo (DS)on consumer preferences. By 
visualizing the distribution of sales across genres and platforms, the study offers actionable insights for publishers and 
marketers. The results show the potential of data-driven approaches in strategic planning and optimizing market performance, 
providing valuable guidance for navigating the video game industry.
